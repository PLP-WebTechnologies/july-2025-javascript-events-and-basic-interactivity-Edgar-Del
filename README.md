# Assignment: Interactive Web Pages with JavaScript

Welcome to the exciting world of interactivity! This assignment is all about **making your web pages feel alive**. You'll learn how to respond to user actions, build engaging components, and validate form input—without reloading the page. This is where JavaScript gets fun, practical, and powerful.

## Part 1: JavaScript Event Handling and Interactive Elements

Let's start with the basics of **event handling**. You'll set up JavaScript to listen for user actions like clicks, mouseovers, keyboard input, and more—and respond to them in meaningful ways.

**Goal:** Use event listeners to react to user behavior and trigger changes on the page (e.g., showing messages, toggling classes, hiding/showing content).

## Part 2: Building Interactive Elements

Now it's time to apply what you've learned by creating your own mini interactive features. You can build things like:

* A light/dark mode toggle
* A counter or button game
* A collapsible FAQ section
* A simple dropdown menu
* A tabbed interface

**Goal:** Use DOM manipulation + events to make the page dynamic and engaging. Be creative!

## Part 3: Form Validation with JavaScript

Forms are essential to the web—and validating them properly is key to good user experience. You'll build a form with multiple input fields (name, email, password, etc.) and write JavaScript to validate each field when the user submits or types.

**Goal:** Prevent incorrect form submissions by writing custom validation logic using conditions and regular expressions. Show user-friendly error messages and success feedback.

## Deliverables

* `index.html`: Your structured web page with at least one form and several interactive sections
* `script.js`: Your JavaScript file with:

  * Event handling for buttons, inputs, or links
  * At least 2 interactive features created from scratch
  * A fully functioning custom form validation (no HTML5-only validation)
* `style.css` (optional but encouraged): To style your interactive elements

Each section of your JavaScript should be commented to explain its purpose.

## Outcome

* Use of event listeners and appropriate event types
* Creativity and functionality of interactive elements
* Form validation accuracy and helpfulness of feedback
* Clear, modular, and well-commented JavaScript code
* A clean and functional user experience
